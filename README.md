JsonModifier was created to help php developers modify Json files by performing _crud_ operations.

> Note: The file should have a valid JSON format like the following example.
``` json
[
   {
      "items":[
         {
            "id":"1",
            "name":"original t-shirt",
            "unitprice":"240.00"
         },
         {
            "id":"2",
            "name":"Cotton Polo Shirt",
            "unitprice":"123.00"
         }
      ]
   }
]
```
